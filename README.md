# Research-Project-One
A theory based exploration of polygon circle properties.
End result an approximation for polygon-circle accuracy.
End result also applicable as a dampened converging harmonic function.

Basis used include well-proven geometric properties:
Conservation of angle of a triangle,
Fundamental properties of arclength and radius,
Geometric properties of a right triangle,
Geometric properties of an isosceles triangle,
Pythagorean theorum,
Fundamental trigometric functions sine and cosine,
Sine-squared power reduction formula.
